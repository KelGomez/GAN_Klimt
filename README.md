GAN Gustave Klimt: Klimt Artwork Generator

In Paris, where I live, there is a beautiful place called “ L’Atelier des Lumières “ in english, The workshop of Light. I was very excited when they re-opened because they were holding an exposition of my favorite artist: Gustave Klimt.

It is a kind of an experimental museum where artwork are projected on the wall on the giant warehouse using powerful projectors. They expploit the unique topology of the inside of the warehouse to create dream like scenaries. Here is a picture to give you an idea:

It was an amazing experience. When I got out, I bought from the museum shop a giant 600 hundred page book called Gustave Klimt Tobias G. Natter. It is a complete collection fo all Klimt collections with high quality commentary.
